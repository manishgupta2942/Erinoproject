 PROBLEM PHASE AND SOME OVERVIEW  OF PAGE
Hello, I created a Contact Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

Frontend:
I used React.js with Vite as the build tool for faster development and better performance.
For styling, I utilized Tailwind CSS, which provided a utility-first approach to design, enabling faster and more responsive UI development.
Backend:
The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, ensuring a robust and scalable server-side application.
MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage contact details efficiently.

I designed the UI to be simple and clear, as this project is a straightforward assignment for Erino.

Since I am currently preparing for my end exams, I have not implemented advanced features like email verification, OTP authentication, or similar concepts. My primary focus was to keep the UI minimalistic and concentrate on implementing the core logic for the application.

This approach allowed me to complete the assignment efficiently while ensuring the project remains functional and serves its intended purpose.

As I have experience working on multiple projects and internships, I didn’t face significant difficulties while working on this project. However,
I did encounter an error that took around two hours to debug. The issue arose because I mistakenly used id instead of _id in the database schema.
This oversight consumed time because I kept assuming, "The mistake can't be here; let me check somewhere else."

Additionally, I faced some challenges with CSS styling since I haven’t extensively used Tailwind CSS before. As a result,
I found it difficult to implement some design elements efficiently. Despite this, I managed to overcome these hurdles and complete the project successfully.

One important point I realized later is that I didn’t make the Contact Page a protected route. This means anyone with the direct URL can access the page without authentication. I actually forgot to implement this feature, which is crucial for restricting unauthorized access.

While working on this project, I focused more on the core logic and functionality, which led me to overlook this aspect. If I revisit this project in the future, adding proper route protection will definitely be a priority.
